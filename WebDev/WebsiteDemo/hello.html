    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
         Development is the most <i>effective and affordable</i> platform to learn how to code and we can take
        <b>real-world</b> experiences.</p>

        <li>Real-world-coding:
            Simply put, coding is used for communicating with computers. People use coding to give computers and other machines instructions on what actions to perform. Further, we use it to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day.

        <li>Affordable:
            Coding bootcamps are worth it for students who need to learn a specific skill quickly. Employers generally regard these programs positively, but want more accountability. Bootcamps are not regionally or nationally accredited. A coding bootcamp does not replicate the depth or scope of a computer science degree
